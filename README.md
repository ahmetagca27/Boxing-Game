The code represents a simple scenario where two fighters, "Marc" and "Alex," are created with their respective attributes such as name, damage, health, weight, dodge, and first hit probability. These fighters are then used to create a match object, specifying weight constraints for the match. Finally, the run() method is called to execute the match.
